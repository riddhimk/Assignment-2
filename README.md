# Assignment-2# Java Array Functions Project

This project demonstrates array and ArrayList manipulation in Java with the following features:

## Features

- **Input Array**: Takes 5 integers from the user and stores them in an array.
- **Even/Odd Separation**: Splits input array into even and odd numbers, displays both lists.
- **Smallest Difference**: Finds and prints the index of the number with the smallest difference from another number.
- **Array to ArrayList**: Converts the input array to an ArrayList and prints it.
- **ArrayList to Array**: Converts an ArrayList back to an array and prints it.

## Classes

- **Input Class**: Takes input from the user and returns an array of integers.
- **ArrayFunctions Class**: Contains methods for:
  - Separating even and odd numbers (`evenOdd()`)
  - Finding the smallest difference (`smallestDifference()`)
  - Converting between array and ArrayList (`arrayToArrayList()`, `arrayListToArray()`)
- **Main Class**: Calls functions from the `ArrayFunctions` class to execute the operations.
